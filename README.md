# typescript-react-todo

This repository contains a React example to implement 'To do' app.

The code is generated by the [create-react-app TypeScript addition](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/).

I walkthrough Chapter 10 of ['리액트를 다루는 기술'](https://m.yes24.com/Goods/Detail/62597469) book, and adopts TypeScript on it.
